I grew up skiing at a mountain known as Lost Valley, in Auburn, Maine. It is one of Maine's many mountains, but is mostly nicknamed a "hill."
I love Lost Valley and was fortunate enough to ski every day when I joined the ski team at my middle school and my high school.

When I was younger I used to just race on Sundays, but when I got older I was able to race/train every day!
